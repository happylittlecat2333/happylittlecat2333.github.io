Hi there! I am currently a graduate student at the [Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications](https://www.bupt.edu.cn/) (BUPT), and my major is Artificial Intelligence. I am supervised by Associate Professor [Ya Li](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=ISK42qAAAAAJ) and I now focus on Speech Synthesis and Spoken Dialogue Systems. I completed my undergraduate degree in Computer Science also at [BUPT](https://www.bupt.edu.cn/).

I have a keen interest in all aspects of Conversational AI. This includes Expressive Speech Synthesis, ChatBot, Empathic Computing, NLP and AIGC. My ultimate goal is to development more intelligent and interactive AI systems with human emotion. 

I decide to pursue a Ph.D. abroad after completing my Master's degree in 2025. **If any professors or researchers are interested in my work or see potential for collaboration, please do not hesitate to contact me!**

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too.
