Hi there! I am currently a master's student at the [Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications](https://www.bupt.edu.cn/) (BUPT), majoring in Artificial Intelligence. I am supervised by Associate Professor [Ya Li](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=ISK42qAAAAAJ), focusing on speech synthesis, NLP, and multimodal generation.

I have a keen interest in all aspects of multimodal generation, including speech synthesis, multimodal LLM, and AIGC. I am also interested in developing intelligent and interactive AI systems with human emotions.

I plan to pursue a Ph.D. abroad after completing my master's degree in 2025. **If any professors or researchers are interested in my work or see potential for collaboration, please do not hesitate to contact me!**

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
